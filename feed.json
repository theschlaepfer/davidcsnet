We moved to a new house in the Live Oak area of Santa Cruz. I visited Zambia, Morocco, and Albania (passing through South Africa, Dubai, and Germany). I had a lot of projects through work that I feel proud of. Our two-year-old became a three-year-old. I got into soccer (NWSL/EPL). Anna got <em>very</em> into knitting and quilting.

We moved to a new house in the Live Oak area of Santa Cruz. I visited Zambia, Morocco, and Albania (passing through South Africa, Dubai, and Germany). I had a lot of projects through work that I feel proud of. Our two-year-old became a three-year-old. I got into soccer (NWSL/EPL). Anna got _very_ into knitting and quilting. We took a couple lovely trips to Lake Tahoe and to Mendocino in the summer.\n\nIn the midst of all of that I also dealt with grief & loss, financial difficulty, deep political anxiety, heavy workloads and an ever-present lack of sleep.

				"content_html": "<p>Finished reading: <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781250065377\">In the Great Green Room</a> by Amy Gary 📚</p>\n<p>Margaret Wise Brown packed a ton of impact into her tragically short lifetime. This book was a fascinating look into that life. The childhood rituals that provided inspiration for her best work, the romantic partners (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wayfarer-James-S-Rockefeller-Jr/dp/1944762574\">male</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Strange\">female</a>) that were her muses, and her struggle to break out of children’s books and into “serious” literature. Ironic, because the fact she wrote some of the most beloved kids’ literature of all time has ensured her reputation will endure.

				"content_text": "Finished reading: [In the Great Green Room](https://micro.blog/books/9781250065377) by Amy Gary 📚\n\nMargaret Wise Brown packed a ton of impact into her tragically short lifetime. This book was a fascinating look into that life. The childhood rituals that provided inspiration for her best work, the romantic partners ([male](https://www.amazon.com/Wayfarer-James-S-Rockefeller-Jr/dp/1944762574) and [female](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Strange)) that were her muses, and her struggle to break out of children’s books and into “serious” literature. Ironic, because the fact she wrote some of the most beloved kids’ literature of all time has ensured her reputation will endure.

				"content_text": "<p>As my daughter (who I’ll refer to as W) has grown up over the past (nearly) three years, there have been a lot of moments for nostalgia for my wife. She grew up with a much younger sibling, so she watched and read a lot of things targeted to younger kids. Movies, books, songs and more.</p>\n\n<p>But I, on the other hand, am the youngest. What I remember from childhood starts once I was old enough to form more solid memories. I have vague hints of places we went or things I did when I was truly little in the back of my mind. A family trip to Yosemite, where I was afraid of a steep cliff. Or riding an innertube on Lake Tahoe. But as far as media goes, my memories tend to start later, in elementary school. I know I watched Barnie, for example, but I have no nostalgia for it because I can’t remember it. That, in turn, has limited the amount of little-kid oriented media I feel nostalgia for.</p>\n\n<p>Well everything changed this month, because W’s been getting into <strong>dragons</strong>. It all started with <em><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/p/books/dragons-love-tacos-adam-rubin/10784082?ean=9780803736801\">Dragons Love Tacos</a></em> – maybe the strangest kids book we’ve read to her so far. But she loves it, and reads it every night. Which ignited deep within me a remembrance of watching PBS as a kid, and loving – what else? – <em>Dragon Tales</em>.</p>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgEoDmY2A3M&pp=ygUXZHJhZ29uIHRhbGVzIHRoZW1lIHNvbmc%3D\">Dragon Tales</a></em> is a classic. It sat amongst shows like <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubH4LDcKRyE\">Between the Lions</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxxsOGQgfIo\">Zoboomafoo</a></em>, and... (shudder) <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iKuda2LL8c\">Caillou</a></em>. It followed the classic trope of kids running off to a fantasy land to learn how to deal with their real-world problems. I have fond memories of watching it in my parent’s bedroom on their CRT on a rainy Saturday morning.</p>\n\n<p>Thing is: it’s impossible to find now... except through the Internet Archive, where all the episodes are downloadable. I feel kind of bad for accessing it this way, but when there’s literally no other way to buy or stream it, what is a parent of a dragon-loving toddler to do?</p>\n\n<p>Suffice to say, W is obsessed. Obsessed to the point of shouting “DRAGON SONG” at us until we play the theme song for her. On repeat. For hours.<sup><a href=\"#fn1-26902\" id=\"fnr1-26902\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>I remember as a kid, my dad would show us cartoons from his childhood. I grew up on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIhEpjnaNlo\">Johnny Quest</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JQbeCAlF6s\">The Jetsons</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uU6KzAbSTg\">Wacky Races</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa1fH0SvGPg\">Underdog</a>. I have nostalgia now for the things my dad had nostalgia for as a young parent. And as I share things from my childhood with my own daughter, someday she too will have nostalgia for the things I did. It’s a big ol’ chain of nostalgia all the way down.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-26902\">\n<p>There’s another post I’d like to write sometime about the way kids love to repeat things that bring them joy. What is it about growing up that makes us need a constant stream of new things to carry us along? Why can’t we sit in something wonderful and enjoy it? Is it an attention span thing? Is it a cultural thing? <a href=\"#fnr1-26902\" title=\"return to article\" class=\"reversefootnote\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

I can see that if I saw it nearly three years ago when it was released I would have been disappointed. As it is though I’m just motivated to see the second part in theaters.</p><p>It seems like this is a story that really benefits from such a long first act. I haven’t read the book, but from what I’ve heard, it’s a lot of fictional politics. Which is a very difficult thing to pull off in a movie (*cough*The Phantom Menace*cough*trade negotiations*cough*). In a book you can stop, re-read, and think about it, whereas a movie just chugs along whether you’re with it or not.</p><p>That being said, I think this movie pulled it off well, at the expense of runtime. Which only makes it necessary to split it into two films. Now that I know fully the stakes at play, and can have several days to ponder it all, I can go into <i>Part 2</i> a little more confident in understanding it all.</p><p>The action here was good, and the worm scenes intense. Things felt tactile and believable (with the exception of one shot that went a little too MCU.) Incredible shot composition.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/theschlaepfer/film/dune-2021/\">View on Letterboxd →</a></p>\n",

I think the opening scene was interesting, but then the two exposition dump scenes that followed were actually shockingly boring. Usually these movies are great at the “show, don’t tell” thing. Or at least “show while telling”. But instead we have a three minute scene of two photographs, a cassette player, and Tom Cruise moving his eyes.</p><p>There are a few other moments like that in the hours that follow (and I have my own dislikes of certain plotting decisions or editing choices), but crucially, the action is still as exciting as ever. And that’s really what we’re all here for, right? I’ve enjoyed the way the McQuarrie movies has melded the intrigue and cat-and-mouse nature of De Palma’s original film with the pure spectacle extravaganza of Brad Bird’s. It hits a really nice balance for me.</p><p>This one might be a little low on the spectacle, but it’s one of two parts. Gotta save the biggest stuff for last. I expect to read a news story about Tom Cruise falling off of a satellite or something this year.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/theschlaepfer/film/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-part-one/\">View on Letterboxd →</a></p>\n",

This is my second Miyazaki film watched in theaters in its initial release. It's an awesome experience. <em>The Wind Rises</em> played fairly straightforward, with some surprises but mostly just a very enjoyable, masterfully crafted movie. <em>The Boy and the Heron</em>, while set in the same time period, couldn't be more different in pacing and tone and almost every other aspect. It's a film so unconventional that there's truly no way to know where things will turn next, and each twist and turn in Miyazaki's fabulous dreamscape delights and disgusts in ways only he can.</p><p>The first time I saw <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em> I had a high fever, it was late at night and I was in a foreign country. My sister and I watched it to keep my spirits up. <em>Totoro</em> is so dreamlike (\"I thought it was a dream!\" \"But it wasn't a dream!\" 🌱), that the next day I remember wondering which parts of that movie were real and which parts were a result of my fever. Miyazaki's worlds are so beautiful and rooted in traditions of our world, but governed by rules of another world entirely. Like a dream, they inherit characters and motifs, but then bend them in ways you'd never expect. In the end you wake up realizing that it didn't make a whole lot of sense, and yet somehow, in a more elemental way, of course it did.</p><p>I have a lot of thoughts on the specifics of this movie, but I want to avoid spoilers as much as possible, so here are some bullet points:</p><ul><li>So many parts reference past Miyazaki worlds and themes, which is fun as a fan.<li>There were so many really laugh-out-loud funny moments, and a few seriously gruesome moments.<li>There are some creatures in this that I imagine will be merchandised the heck out of and I will buy every bit of it.<li>The ending I thought was a bit odd in the moment, but has grown on me a lot while thinking about it, and right now I don't feel like it's worth a mark against the film.<li>We watched the dub and I have to say everyone did a fantastic job. Robert Pattinson especially deserves a lot of praise for his role. I honestly forgot it was him until the credits rolled. Florence Pugh also really knocked it out of the park. And Willem Dafoe's role is very short but the gravitas of his voice lends itself so well to the scene.</ul><p>Still picking up the pieces of it but I'm coming away from this just so grateful that this man and this studio is still making movies (and apparently are in the early stages of another!). If you are on the fence, <em>definitely</em> see this, and see it in theaters while you still can!</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/theschlaepfer/film/the-boy-and-the-heron/\">View on Letterboxd →</a></p>\n",

I laughed quite a bit more than I thought I would and the chemistry between the leads is pretty good. Love the Khan family, easily stole every scene they were in. The plotting is very rough and the final act is extremely ho hum (these heroes <i>really</i> need to start by talking with the “bad guys” and seeing how they can help with their problems). But that’s pretty much par for the course for Marvel.</p><p>At the end of the day, I got to sit in a theater and forget about work and eat some candy.

On one hand, you have very explicit reflexivity like <i>F for Fake </i>and nostalgia like <i>Cinema Paradiso</i> or <i>The Fabelmans</i>. On the other hand is a more subtle reflexivity, like the monolith and interstellar trip of <i>2001</i> and the hidden, behind-the-scenes reflexivity of the probably hundreds of obsessive, possibly self-destructive actors/directors/screenwriters who have slaved away creating films about obsessive, definitely self-destructive characters — <i>Fitzcarraldo, The Phantom Thread, </i>probably every Wes Anderson film, and definitely anything Charlie Kaufman makes.</p><p>Any work of art reflects the human beings involved in its creation. This transcends film - writing, painting, interactive media and music all carry this same fingerprint. But (at the moment) film is the only way to capture that behind the scenes hidden truth.</p><p>Or… is it? By turning the camera away from the actors and towards the director, do they just become another actor? What about the sound recordist or the camera operator? This is <i>Symbiopsychotaxiplasm</i>, an incredibly silly film at its core about the act of observing anything, or being watched by anything, and how that changes everything or maybe nothing at all.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/theschlaepfer/film/symbiopsychotaxiplasm-take-one/\">View on Letterboxd →</a></p>\n",

This sub-hour whirlwind packs pretty much every tool he has into its limited runtime. With everything we watch there’s an element of suspension of disbelief, and what Wes does so well in his films is he essentially races to break any semblance of believable façade as fast as possible. He just takes a stop-motion yellow-and-pink sledgehammer to that concept and allows us to <i>see</i> that it’s fake, <i>acknowledge</i> it, and <i>move on</i> with the story and format, now with a lighter tone and more breathing room to play with. Many filmmakers work within the ever-tightening boundaries of “will people believe this effect?” or “is this too cheesy?” Wes Anderson operates at a complete inverse. The cheese is the point, and you know he’ll pick the finest aged gruyère.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/theschlaepfer/film/the-wonderful-story-of-henry-sugar/\">View on Letterboxd →</a></p>\n",

We pass the community house that I had lived in for a year, now a pile of ground-up foundation. Continuing on, we pass the last cabin standing, and pull in facing the field where the redwood stage is. A fence lines the field, where cabin leaders stood every Sunday to greet their campers.

There are no campers sitting on Hamburger Hill making lanyards in the shade of the maple tree. Words leave me.\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/90877/2023/62be978d-e280-4d81-a46f-e2999b41354e-1-201-a.jpeg)\n\nThere are places that we hold _so_ dear. These places, like everything in our lives, are _so_ impermanent. Everything is transient. What remains are the memories and images that fill the gaps. When I think about my Oma, I see a woman so strong in her faith and her love for her family, cutting me bite sized pieces of butter and jelly toast, calling me her schunka bolle. She's gone now. But my mind fills the gap she left with those memories, and those memories will stay with me forever and inform the choices I make if I have grandchildren of my own.\n\nThe memories that fill the gaps of Camp Hammer are many. The buildings are gone but its woods and its people remain, for a moment. And those memories and people will inform the next chapter of camp, whatever it ends up being.\n\n",

There’s lots that is icky in this, but for example: I don’t know how I feel about Peter’s characterization in this film. He goes from “the Guardians don’t kill” to “kill them all” in like… two scenes. Not to mention the least emotional reaction to the death of a literal entire planet since Alderaan. Or just… War Pig.

Not that it’s a bad style! Just spawned a lot of copycats that could never quite match Pixar’s level of polish.</p><p>We’re sort of seeing a similar thing now in a post-<i>Spiderverse</i> (or is it post-<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/126287950/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Klaus</i>-teaser</a>? or even post-<i>Paperman</i>?) where we have a whole lot of films coming out with this 2.5D blend. Part of me worries that it’ll grow old too, but the difference with this art style is it allows for so much more flavor. <i>Paperman’s</i> filmic fluid style couldn’t be more different than the animated-on-threes action sequences in <i>Puss and Boots: The Last Wish</i>. But both reflect unique approaches to animation that celebrates the medium’s unrivaled flexibility.</p><p>For <i>Puss and Boots</i>, it lends itself extremely well to its representation of Puss’s relentless stalker and his subsequent panic attacks (a surprisingly heavy-hitting theme throughout the film). And the strongly keyframed action sequences offer a visual buffet without getting lost in the noise, something that most live-action action films lack. Looking at you, Marvel (also looking at you, <i>Speed Racer</i>, for being so ahead of your time in this regard).</p><p>Bummed it took me this long to get around to watching this. There’s a particular impression of a certain actor towards the end that cracked me up.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/theschlaepfer/film/puss-in-boots-the-last-wish/\">View on Letterboxd →</a></p>\n",

This is a dramatization of a play within a made-up story about a playwright within a local television station’s evening programming. Still, it’s so easy to forget that, as the actors (or the actors of the actors of the actors) play their parts so well, I found myself getting emotionally invested in the fate of an urn that was simply a Tupperware prop of a prop of a prop.</p><p>If none of this makes sense to you, don’t worry. It doesn’t make much sense to me either - or even to some of the characters of the film. This is a movie about accepting that strange things happen. That events and occurrences in our life often cause us to wake up to a different reality, or realize that perhaps we had been sleeping without knowing it. It’s about getting outside of your head. Which is a remarkable theme for a director who - I’m convinced - has a cross-sectioned diorama for a brain.</p><p>Remarkably funny throughout with some very magical and chilling moments that took my breath away. Despite that, the gestalt of it still falls somewhere below his masterpieces (which are, in my opinion, and in some sort of rough order, <i>Grand Budapest</i>, <i>Mr Fox</i>, <i>Moonrise Kingdom</i>, <i>Tenenbaums</i>).</p><p>—</p><p>As a side note, the theater I saw this in (Scotts Valley CineLux) didn’t have its surround system working properly. So unless this movie was mixed in mono (wouldn’t put it past Wes) there’s a good chance I missed some important audio cues. 😒 Indy earlier today (same theater) had rough sound too.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/theschlaepfer/film/asteroid-city/\">View on Letterboxd →</a></p>\n",

But overall a really fun popcorn flick, which is all this franchise was ever meant to be at its core.

Although I’m looking forward to a rewatch where I don’t have them talking in my ear and where I can pause to use the restroom.</p><p>Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Harrison Ford totally nail it, and Mads does his thing well. Direction is solid, but the plot could have used some clarity.

(With the caveat that, of course, it’s still a product of its time.) C.C. Baxter tries so hard to fit into the misogynistic guy’s club of his workplace and society as a whole, and prioritizes success over pretty much everything else: honesty, dignity, sleep. Because he’s a taker, <i>not</i> the one getting took.</p><p>You could view it as a gender divide or a class divide or a combination of both, but it’s clear that when takes a side - the <i>successful</i> side - in front of Fran, he becomes this other category of human. And when he chooses, proudly, to become a mensch, a human again, that’s where he finds peace.

The end of his shift is seconds away... and then the hands of the clock move backwards. Everyone who’s worked a day in their life can relate.</li><li>Brigitte Helm!! What a crazy performance. To swing between two extremes of acting like that... just incredible. Also... Saoirse Ronan is clearly her reincarnated.</li><li>“MOLOCH!”</li><li>The chase scene in the catacombs. Very inventive use of light and framing. Brigitte Helm’s movements are almost dance-like.</li><li>Speaking of dance-like... the robot Maria’s dancing is hilarious. Literally the most goofy dancing caught on film and all the dudes in attendance are like 👁️🫦👁️</li><li>The creatively animated intertitles were incredible.

Like a heist film but for village defense.<br />- The way the daisies shook while Katsushiro watched that first sword fight with the bandits was a perfect way to make the tension palpable.<br />- Wasn’t completely satisfied with the way Shino is treated. Obviously Manzo isn’t cast in the greatest light. His “damaged goods” line would either not be present in a modern rendition, or he would have been strongly rebuked by the samurai. Instead it’s sort of left unspoken, and it seems Shino might never recover from the shame. A smaller tragedy in the grander tragedy this movie tells.<br />- Teared up when Kikuchiyo was holding the village orphan. He went from my least favorite character to top three at least by the end of the film. Now That’s What I Call Character Redemption®︎.<br />- Even in small village skirmishes, war is hell.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/theschlaepfer/film/seven-samurai/\">View on Letterboxd →</a></p>\n",

Weird film to watch right after <i>A Brighter Summer Day</i>. Almost antithetical in terms of form. Heavy emphasis on the feeling of the moment that it’s capturing. Would love to read more on this because I think I didn’t approach it with the right headspace or context.

The whole second chapter is fantastic. The scene at the gas station is perfection. There are some genuinely very funny moments. The end credits scene is hypnotic and wonderful. The entire film is shot beautifully. Danny Elfman’s score stole some scenes for me.</p><p>But the bad… the stilted dialogue. The poor pacing. The constant philosophizing about every mundane thing. I haven’t read the book, and I don’t have a plan to. I’ve heard it’s good and I trust that. The dialogue here seems like it would work much better in a format where you can stop for a moment and ponder over what someone just said rather than just barreling through to the next thing. It’s like Baumbach tried to fit as many lines from the book in each square millimeter of film as possible. It just didn’t work for me. What could be some interesting tidbits of truth turn into a downpour of pompous pontifications, pounding away at the point, duh, death’s at the door and you’re feeling down. So what? It’s all a distraction from the truest question in life, which of course is: <i>Do sheep have lashes?</i></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/theschlaepfer/film/white-noise-2022/\">View on Letterboxd →</a></p>\n",

Which means I still really greatly enjoyed it. Such a weird movie. Stunned by the beauty of the water, of course, but also by how long we just linger in the water with the characters. A lot of times films will have some very impressive shots but keep them short and sweet, or few and far between to stretch the budget. Clearly money was no object and James Cameron was like “screw it, let’s just play in the water for an hour”.</p><p>The action and tension is 100% a vehicle for more cool water scenes. And that’s fine! And the movie is clear that that’s the case. The whole engine/catalyst behind the events of the movie is pure popcorn sci-if cinema. Because it all just gets us back to playing in the water with our cool new alien friends. :)</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/theschlaepfer/film/avatar-the-way-of-water/\">View on Letterboxd →</a></p>\n",

He brings that in his performance as well – aside from the accent, there are some tics that are very subtle but very accurate to Christopher Walken.<br />- “What‘s she gonna be? A shoe salesman at a centipede farm?”<br />- “Frank… you’re not a Lutheran?”<br />- Throughout the year, if Anna and I are talking and someone who’s named Frank comes up in convo, I have like this muscle memory impulse to say “Frahnk.

This feels like a story torn between two movies: one an emotional drama about losing a loved one and a leader that needs to deliver on a promise to provide solace and introspection to the audience, the other a blockbuster action flick that needs to deliver on a promise to provide spectacle to the audience. Ultimately it underdelivers in both camps. I feel as though Ryan Coogler wanted to make a more intimate Shuri-focused film, evidenced by several scenes that feel integral to her development as a character but maybe not relevant to the development of the primary storyline with Namor. There’s just too much going on that steals that focus away, with Ironheart and Julia-Louis Dreyfuss’s storylines in particular tugging away at the frayed edges. By the time the video-game-action-figure-green-screen-epic-battle rolls around, I knew it was time to finally take that pee break(2) because nothing would happen for the next ten minutes.</p><p>(1) Not like <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quantumania</a>.<br />(2) I do not recommend watching a movie about ocean people with liquid bombs and trickling, gurgling sfx when ya gotta go 😕</p>\n",

Some of the funniest gags in a Christmas movie for sure. And honestly a pretty touching moment at the end.

To become wooden. To have dry lips. To actually tremble at the thought of reaching out your hand to them. In <i>Carol</i>’s early moments, Therese is literally stunned by Carol in this way. Clearly she’s attracted. But she can’t make a move – how could she in <i>her</i> <i>presence?</i> Carol recognizes this and guides her gently along by the shoulder. She makes the moves and Therese follows willingly.</p><p>The grammar of the film makes this tension so insanely palpable. The soft focus on the even softer fur of Carol’s coat. The way we watch her fingers depress the buttons on the dashboard. How loud every small sound is in the room with her. Everything works together to beckon Therese to follow.</p><p>In the end, Therese doesn’t follow. She rejects Carol’s propositions. Instead, she approaches Carol on her own terms, each on level footing, with an endless sunrise ahead.</p>\n",

Several not cute parts. It wants to be a deep and thoughtful will-they-won’t-they romance, but also a cheesy Netflick with canned sfx gasps and an “and everyone clapped” moment.</p><p>When we watched the Dear Evan Hansen movie, I thought a lot about how hard it is to write a character that straddles the line between cringey-but-lovable weirdo and sociopathic weirdo. Evan Hansen is a sociopathic weirdo with very few redeeming qualities or reasons to root for him, Ben Platt’s dulcet tones be damned. So it’s hard to watch a film when you don’t buy the lead role. Or in The Half of It, the supporting role. Paul is a moron. Not really a likable moron. Just a moron.</p><p>Maybe I’m being hard on him. I thought Daniel Diemer did fine with the cards he was dealt. Actually all the actors were fine, with Leah Lewis really bringing it. But the writing does Diemer’s character especially dirty. Maybe in a dumber high school film his character would shine more. But this is a film that quotes Sartre and Camus, and features a classic film geek dad, rich set design and legitimately gorgeous shot composition. Ellie sets a bar for romancing Aster that Paul could never meet, and the film’s production design sets a bar for quality that the writing could never meet.</p>\n",

Star Wars Episode IX… take notes.</p> </li> <li> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/loki-2021/\">Loki</a> </li> <li> <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-avengers-2012/\">The Avengers</a> <p>Didn’t like this when it first came out, but honestly it’s fantastic. This feels like the best time the MCU fully cashed in on the sensation of so many different heroes with really unique strengths and abilities. Well choreographed, and comparable to <i>Incredibles</i> when it comes to good superhero fight scenes. Do wish the Chitauri were more visually interesting.
