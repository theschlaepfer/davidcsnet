			 <p>Feels like a good time to put a few of my beliefs in writing. A very incomplete list.</p>
<ol>
<li>I believe in a loving God that wants us to love others. This is something that I feel very strongly. I am a Christian and want to follow after the example for living that Christ left.</li>
<li>I believe that LGBTQ+ people deserve the same human rights as everyone else. That they are deserving of love, peace and recognition. That people <em>need</em> to have the right to choose what they do with their own bodies, and deserve respect.</li>
<li>I believe that these first two points are not in conflict with each other, and in fact are stronger taken together. I disagree with those who force these positions into two warring factions, and <em>especially</em> with those who use the Christian faith as a tool to oppress people.</li>
<li>We need more trains.</li>

<h2 id="what-happened">What happened?</h2>
<p>Lots! We moved to a new house in the Live Oak area of Santa Cruz. I visited Zambia, Morocco, and Albania (passing through South Africa, Dubai, and Germany). I had a lot of projects through work that I feel proud of. Our two-year-old became a three-year-old. I got into soccer (NWSL/EPL). Anna got <em>very</em> into knitting and quilting. We took a couple lovely trips to Lake Tahoe and to Mendocino in the summer.</p>
<p>In the midst of all of that I also dealt with grief &amp; loss, financial difficulty, deep political anxiety, heavy workloads and an ever-present lack of sleep. I anticipate all of these will appear again in the next year. Not trying to be pessimistic, but noting for myself that I experienced these hardships and still came out the other side feeling like it was overall a good year.</p>
<h2 id="what-media-did-i-consume">What media did I consume?</h2>
<p>(Nom nom nom.)</p>
<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>Bonny Light Horseman’s <a href="https://blh.lnk.to/keep-me-on-your-mind-see-you-free"><strong><em>Keep Me on Your Mind/See You Free</em></strong></a> is my album of the year. Also really loved Jessica Pratt’s <em>Here in the Pitch</em>, Khruangbin’s <em>A La Sala</em>, Soccer Mommy’s <em>Evergreen</em>, Adrianne Lenker’s <em>Bright Future</em>, Los Campesinos’ <em>All Hell</em>, The Decemberists’ <em>As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again</em>, Waxahatchee’s <em>Tiger Blood</em>, Yasmin Williams’ <em>Acadia</em>, and Bon Iver’s <em>SABLE, - EP</em>, in no particular order. And… yes… <em>Brat</em> too. I have a <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/best-of-2024/pl.u-6MbeFZl3mrl">favorites playlist here on Apple Music</a>.</p>
<h3 id="tv">TV</h3>
<p>Anna and I are absolutely freaking out over <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/silo/umc.cmc.3yksgc857px0k0rqe5zd4jice"><strong><em>Silo</em></strong></a> right now, so I guess that’s my show of the year. I also really enjoyed <em>Trying</em>, though we haven’t finished the last season yet, and <em>Bad Monkey</em>, which was really fun.</p>
<h3 id="movies">Movies</h3>
<p>I watched six movies released this year. My ratings are tied for first between <a href="https://davidcs.net/2024/08/29/dune-part-two.html" title="2024-08-29"><em>Dune: Part Two</em></a> and <a href="https://davidcs.net/2024/12/14/wicked.html"><em>Wicked</em></a>, both great movies. But I think I’d give the edge to <a href="https://davidcs.net/2024/12/14/wicked.html" title="2024-12-14"><strong><em>Wicked</em></strong></a> for my favorite. I also really enjoyed <a href="https://davidcs.net/2024/07/19/inside-out.html" title="2024-07-19"><em>Inside Out 2</em></a>.</p>
<h3 id="games">Games</h3>
<p>I don’t think I played anything that released in 2024. But I did play a few older games: <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, <em>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Remastered</em>, <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>, <em>Stray</em>, most of <em>Grim Fandango Remastered</em> (until it soft locked me 😢), and just a smidgen of <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. I don’t really have a ton of time to play games, and I have a massive backlog of purchases. Like most people I guess!</p>
<h2 id="did-i-meet-my-goals">Did I meet my goals?</h2>
<p>Yes and no:</p>
<p><strong>Downsize</strong> ✅ - But we need to do it again!</p>
<p><strong>Read a book each month</strong> ❌ - I failed this. But I did end up reading seven books and am on an eighth. Probably better than any other year of my life after high school!</p>
<p><strong>Brush up on a language</strong> ❌ - I tried a few times, but couldn’t establish a routine. I ended up traveling through Germany this year and also attending a few Spanish-language events. In both instances, I was kicking myself for not learning these languages. There’s a possibility of both this year again, so I’m going to try and recommit to this.</p>
<p><strong>Establish a workout rhythm</strong> ✅❌ - Going to put both a check and an X here because I <em>did</em> have a great routine, mostly through jogging and riding my bike to work. But this fall has been a really hard one mentally, so my desire to exercise has plummeted. But I know how good it feels now, so there’s hopefully less friction to get back into it.</p>
<p><strong>Use public transit</strong> ❌ - The distance I live from work right now is a funny one. It’s about 10 minutes by car, 20 minutes by bike, and 30-40 minutes by bus. So bike or car tends to win out for this, as much as I’d like to kick my car dependency to the curb.</p>
<p><strong>Unlock the power of Costco</strong> ❌ - We did do some meal planning for a bit that centered around Costco’s crazy good price for rotisserie chicken. Cut down on grocery cost a bit. But… there’s also so much there that’s tempting in the way of cheap clothes and snacks and crap. I don’t know if I’m disciplined enough to avoid spending a ton there on stuff I don’t need.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-my-goals-for-2025">What are my goals for 2025?</h2>
<h3 id="post-a-picture-everyday">Post a picture everyday</h3>
<p>Over on <a href="https://glass.photo">Glass</a>, a good amount of people will do photo-a-day challenges, where, for a full year, they take a photo and post it each day. I’ve heard from a few people that this starts as a good excuse to get out and walk about and stretch yourself photographically, but it turns into a burden. And you know what I need more of in my life? More burdens. So I’m going to try it out for a bit. If it sucks, it sucks and I’ll drop it.</p>
<h3 id="stick-to-bullet-journaling">Stick to Bullet Journaling</h3>
<p>For Christmas I got the Leuchtturm 1917 Bullet Journal, which is hefty and beautiful and came with a sweet pen. I like handwriting notes, especially when I’m in a face-to-face meeting, and I like the tactile nature of it. BuJo as a philosophy interests me, especially the ability to expand and rework it to fit your own needs. It’s like the Notion of pen-and-paper note-taking systems. (What <em>doesn’t</em> interest me is the courses and books etc. offered by the company or by productivity influencers… but I get it. People gotta eat.)</p>
<h3 id="redesign-my-site">Redesign my site</h3>
<p>I hesitate putting this as a goal, because it’s really more of an inevitability. I updated my site in a lot of ways this past year, mostly in colors and fonts. But I’d like to do a rethink of the flow of the site, to be a bit more useful as a portfolio as well as a blog. I want it to be simple and beautiful, a way to showcase my images and video work just as well as my words. I think I can manage it, it’s more about finding the time!</p>
<h3 id="get-back-out-there---running--biking">Get back out there - running &amp; biking</h3>
<p>So I established jogging as a viable exercise routine last year. I also moved to a lovely area of town with plenty of quiet streets – much better than the busy mountain road we lived on a year ago. My goal for this year is to stick with it! I have a tentative desire to run in some kind of 5K/10K kind of thing, of which there are plenty in our area. We’ll see.</p>
<p>As for biking, I just love it. I have a 7 speed city bike and a pannier bag and everything. I have jealousy for e-bikes because there are a few big, unavoidable hills on my route. But I can do it, it’s all there in my legs! I just need to tap into it.</p>
<h3 id="budget-for-me-time">Budget for “me time”</h3>
<p>This one is a bit wishy washy. I don’t know how I’m really going to go about it. But part of the reason I couldn’t read a book a month last year (other than my achingly slow reading speed) is that it’s hard to find the time for it. Between video editing/producing, doing dishes, washing laundry, dealing with our threenager, getting groceries, doing the dishes again, folding that laundry that’s been sitting there for a week, etc… it’s just hard.</p>
<hr>
<p>And that’s that! We’ll see where I am a year from now when I write the next yearly update. ✌️</p>

			 <p>Christmas is a weird time of year for me. I flip flop between being excited/festive and being depressed/cynical. I think many feel the same. It can be an awful combination of high expenses, dreary weather, small talk with friends you once knew but can’t <em>really</em> connect with anymore, family members missed, and unspoken expectations that weren’t met. But at the same time, everything is bathed in twinkly lights, beautiful colors, warm music, big hugs, and so much to eat. High highs and low lows.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s why <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em> has such a cultural relevance, even at nearly sixty years old. This is not a new phenomenon, feeling left behind by the season. If Chuck can overcome it, I can too.<br>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780575097766">The Hero of Ages</a> by Brandon Sanderson 📚</p>
<p>I’ve come to expect a pattern with Sanderson’s writing style. Generally, they start with a tease. Something to hook me in and wonder, “What was that all about?” Then it’s Exposition City, as I learn about the world, its history, its magic, the characters and their motivations.  There is ample time provided to become comfortable in this new reality.</p>
<p>Then, somewhere around 60% through, something breaks.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s a character I thought I could trust showing their true allegiance, or a rule of the magic system being broken, or plans completely falling apart. Whatever it is, the world is now completely different. I wonder about it just as the characters do, searching for the actual <strong>truth</strong>. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I think that’s what’s kept me interested in these books. I love going down Wikipedia rabbit trails, or wondering about something and then researching the heck out of it. So when an author offers the promise of hidden knowledge I have no choice but to continue. I felt this watching <em>Lost</em>, or more recently <em>Severance</em>.</p>
<p>Sanderson’s strength, though, is on delivering on his promise. <em>Lost’s</em> truth was underwhelming. <em>Mistborn’s</em> truth is <strong>transcendent</strong>. There were times when I audible gasped, or pumped my fist in the air. Either I had an inkling of what would come to pass and been confirmed, or I had been absolutely blindsided. In either case, it’s simply exhilarating.</p>
<p>I am going to take a break from the Cosmere series while I read some books either lent to me or that I purchased and feel obligated to read. But I’m looking forward to returning to this wider universe soon.</p>

<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>That’s most apparent in <em>Hero of Ages</em>, as Sazed’s character is explicitly searching for the truth of the world they inhabit.

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781250065377">In the Great Green Room</a> by Amy Gary 📚</p>
<p>Margaret Wise Brown packed a ton of impact into her tragically short lifetime. This book was a fascinating look into that life. The childhood rituals that provided inspiration for her best work, the romantic partners (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wayfarer-James-S-Rockefeller-Jr/dp/1944762574">male</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Strange">female</a>) that were her muses, and her struggle to break out of children’s books and into “serious” literature. Ironic, because the fact she wrote some of the most beloved kids’ literature of all time has ensured her reputation will endure. Few things are as sturdy against time as songs and stories told to and by children.</p>
<p>What strikes me about her work is that they aren’t often fantastical, even as they involve anthropomorphic characters. They are instead very rooted in poetry and the present. <em>Goodnight, Moon</em> is like a mindfulness practice for toddlers, and <em>The Runaway Bunny</em>’s themes show up even in modern work like <a href="https://youtu.be/VKSHJaagYX8?t=197&amp;si=aHDoD1WpMkYI9GZg"><em>Everything, Everywhere, All at Once</em></a>. The stories are simple and universal, not concerned with high moral concepts, endowing even the simplest things in the world with love and wonder.</p>
<p>Some stray quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[Margaret] recently had an article published on how to select the proper book for a child. In it, she encouraged parents to find stories told in simple words about familiar things. The color of the sky, the feel of rain, even tables and telephones might be commonplace to parents, but to children, everything in the world is new and wildly exciting. She believed frightening fairy tales should be avoided for younger children who had yet to learn what is real and what is not. To them, a witch or goblin is as real as a horse or chicken. Older children, depending on their environment, understood the difference between fantasy and reality; they could enjoy those stories without harmful results. It was important for children to find the fun and adventure in folktales and legends since they were based in nature and were often a window into human nature. Word patterns, rhymes, and rhythms were also something she suggested parents look for in a book because they mimicked children&rsquo;s playful language. Sudden changes and sharp contrasts in sound kept their attention, and it delighted them to hear a cat meow or a train go <em>pocketa-pocketa-pocketa</em>. Stories should be short—no more than ten or fifteen minutes unless the readers involved the children in the stories through questions, which gave them a chance to be part of the narratives, Margaret explained that the purpose of books for young children was not so much to educate them as to echo their laughter and sadness, to capture the reality of the world they loved. Children were sensitive to subtle overtones and rhythms and eager to hear them reflected in stories, songs, and poems. She believed that unless parents encouraged those senses, they became blunted by the age of five. Literature gave them back their own world and kept the keenness of their senses alive.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“&hellip;a teacher was to be a facilitator instead of an instructor. They were to guide and encourage children as they learned. All children &hellip;  were explorers on the greatest journey of their lives—that of childhood.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“[Margaret and Michael Strange’s] bond was unrefined, Margaret thought. They got lost in each other. Separation from each other was no longer possible. Michael would take a part of Margaret with her, but part of her would live on in Margaret.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[The book off with Margaret’s own writing, when she hoped to write a biography of her and Michael’s life together:] “That is the significance of this biography, one who has dared to be gloriously good and gloriously bad in one life. No Limbo for her. Rather let life itself grow living monuments out of trees and living words so that death can never take from our half-lives this radiant living that was lived among us.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty much couldn’t put it down for the last 200 pages or so. Like all the best heist stories, it gets <em>really</em> good when everything goes <em>really</em> wrong. Anticipated some of the twists but was blindsided by others.</p>

<p>I actually finished reading this a while ago. I liked it a lot. Enough to maybe continue on the Brandon Sanderson journey a bit. Some things are a bit dated - especially in the way he wrote his female lead characters. I found it hard to break into at first since it’s so heavy on exposition, but the twists partway through were genuinely surprising and renewed interest for me.</p>

			 <p>Looking at my Letterboxd average review scores and it seems like I have a four-star wall:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/90877/2024/e129882d-c9db-4d21-a3af-38ac124d5497.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>This isn’t as prominent as some I’ve seen. But it did get me thinking about why this is. Most importantly– I don’t like watching bad movies. To borrow words from a famous food critic, if I know I won’t like a movie, “I don’t swallow.” That reasonably skews my movie selection in the direction of things I’ll rate higher (i.e. above three-ish stars). I also have very limited time as a dad, so I need to choose wisely.</p>
<p>That being said, I tend to root for movies. Even when they’re uneven, I will rate them well if I enjoyed myself. Two and two-and-a-half feel reserved for movies I genuinely didn’t enjoy, but were still watchable, in a sort of “this sure is a movie” sense. Anything below that is borderline unwatchable. Most movies I watch are “meh” or better, so three and up it is.</p>
<p>(On the other side of the wall, four and half is reserved for movies I think are <em>great</em> and some of my favorites. A full five indicates a movie I struggle to find fault with. Obviously pretty rare.)</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In January I made a list of goals for this year. Now that we’re in May, it&rsquo;s a good time to check up on them:</p>
<h2 id="downsize-">Downsize ✅</h2>
<p>We moved (ironically into a larger place) and in the process found a boatload of stuff to get rid of. Having a garage sale later this month so I&rsquo;m considering this checked!</p>
<h2 id="read-a-book-each-month-">Read a book each month ❌</h2>
<p>Failed. Missed February and April. But I’m not going to let that stop me from reading the rest of this year. That’s kind of the benefit of an early streak-breaker. It means you no longer have the pressure to uphold the streak, and you can focus on the enjoyment of it instead! The next book I&rsquo;m starting is Warbreaker by Brandon Sanderson. Finding it hard to break into the worldbuilding of it. Sometimes it&rsquo;s tough to hold it all in my brain.</p>
<h2 id="brush-up-on-a-language-">Brush up on a language ❌</h2>
<p>No way. I have not touched a single language learning thing this year. Not happening, sorry past me. Maybe next year.</p>
<h2 id="establish-a-workout-rhythm-">Establish a workout rhythm ✅(?)</h2>
<p>Yes kinda, I’m biking to work maybe half the time so I guess that’s something of a rhythm. Would love to do something for my upper body cause I’m a puny weakling. We’ll see. It&rsquo;s hard to fit gyms into my life right now, so I guess I need to figure out at-home workouts. Tips recommended.</p>
<h2 id="use-public-transit-">Use public transit ✅(?)</h2>
<p>On rainy or exceptionally windy days when I have the time I’ll take the bus. It’s about twice as long as on bike, but it’s not so bad. Gives me more opportunity to read. Santa Cruz is putting in a bus priority lane on the highway so there&rsquo;s a good chance my bus ride frequency will increase.</p>
<h2 id="unlock-the-power-of-costco-">Unlock the power of Costco ❌</h2>
<p>Not yet. Still studying the ancient texts.</p>
<hr>
<p>Well I guess a 50% success rate is alright. It&rsquo;s ok to make goals and then later realize they aren&rsquo;t priorities anymore. That&rsquo;s part of life!</p>

			 <p>Earlier this year, I told <a href="https://socel.net/@catsandmaidens">Anna</a> that I had the desire to watch some sort of sport. I’ve watched football and baseball with my parents growing up, but I’ve never really made it my own. It would be nice to cheer on a team for the first time in years, in my own understated way. I settled on baseball and soccer and picked teams:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.mlb.com/giants">SF Giants</a> seemed to be doing pretty well this off-season in terms of signings, so I decided to start watching them more this season. Since then, they have had a pretty terrible record (the Oakland A’s are doing better - <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2023/06/mlb-oakland-as-worst-baseball-team-ever-vegas.html">which is saying something</a>) and have lost some very embarrassing games (<a href="https://youtu.be/mBlccmLN8L8?si=KChkH8DuxZVNj0YR">17-1 loss to the D-Backs</a> comes to mind).</li>
<li>I decided to follow <a href="https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com">Tottenham Hotspur</a> on the advice of a friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/-y3kwmbny-4?si=t7CTmW8ic-FlopzE">The first game I watched</a>, sort of still on the fence, they won handily. I love the coach, and seemed like a neat culture, so I decided to go all in on supporting them. Immediately following, they’ve had their worst <a href="https://theathletic.com/5473251/2024/05/06/tottenham-liverpool-emerson-royal/?source=user_shared_article">losing streak</a> in nearly 20 years. Come on you spurs…</li>
<li>And I’ve been following <a href="https://bayfc.com">Bay FC</a>, because they’re the new kids on the block in the NWSL, have some <a href="https://theathletic.com/5272990/2024/02/13/racheal-kundananji-bay-fc-transfer/?source=user_shared_article">world class players</a>, and it’s exciting to have a soccer team in the bay that actually seems competitive (looking at you, Earthquakes). Well… maybe <em>seemed</em> competitive. They’ve now lost six of their eight games played thus far.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I guess if you have a sports team you love, you ought to start pitching me on becoming a fan of your rivals.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780061142024">Stardust</a> by Neil Gaiman 📚</p>
<p>A fun cat-and-mouse-and-bigger-cat adventure. It took me a little while to settle into the rhythm of it. Things just happen, supernatural stuff hidden in the prose, and you kind of think, “Did I just read that?” Just like Tristran (a name unpronounceable in my mind) might have thought, “Did I just see that?” But once you learn to roll with it and let it wash over you it’s wonderful. The ending is a bit anticlimactic, but I think that&rsquo;s ok. It reads more like a legend than a blockbuster so that works in its favor, I think.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday, <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2024/01/24/s-f-senator-scott-wiener-intros-bill-to-limit-cap-speeds-of-new-cars">Scott Wiener announced a bill</a> that would see speed governors installed in all vehicles sold in California starting in 2027. I think this is fantastic. And not just the term “speed governor” which evokes the image of Arnold Schwarzenegger in the Mach 5.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/90877/2024/speed-governor.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I am so sorry.</p>
<p>Anyways I think it’s ridiculous that we just sell cars that can go 100+ mph and think humans can resist the temptation. But some of the biggest benefits might come at lower speeds.</p>
<p><a href="https://aaafoundation.org/impact-speed-pedestrians-risk-severe-injury-death/">If you get hit by a car traveling about 25 mph, there’s about a 10% chance of you dying, and a 25% chance of you getting severely injured</a>. That’s the standard speed limit for most neighborhoods (but frankly depending on the neighborhood that can feel too fast).</p>
<p>Say someone’s late for work and trying to shave off a minute of their drive, and they hit you at a speed of about 40 mph. Your chances of death just jumped to 50% and your chance of severe injury is 75%. Basically it’s a small miracle if you’re at all ok after that. 35 mph is a standard for busier city streets and arteries, and I’d wager most people go at least 40 in a 35 zone.</p>
<p>I greatly dislike the culture around speeding. Especially people bragging about how much time they shaved off their 30 minute commute. The fact is speeding often doesn’t get you places noticeably quicker – the risk:reward ratio is terrible. Maybe you save 5 minutes: what are you going to do with all that time on your hands?</p>
<p>That being said, it’s not uncommon for me to realize I’m speeding because I got distracted by something and wasn’t paying close attention. I think it’s a shame we built our country’s transportation infrastructure around a system where people die if a human gets too distracted, and then built our economy around things that distract humans.</p>
<p>Regardless of the reason for speeding, we don’t need it. If we can save lives by limiting the speed of cars, then we needed it to happen yesterday.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781782275015">The Honjin Murders</a> by Seishi Yokomizo 📚</p>
<p>Fun, lightweight read - finished it in two sittings. A nice way to start my goal of reading a book each month. It was a bit difficult at times to wrap my head around the terminology, especially because the murders are intrinsically connected to traditional Edo-era building design. But the translation is explanatory in a way that feels fairly natural. I’m not entirely certain of the history of the book but it feels like it must have been a serial release because nearly every chapter ends on a cliffhanger. In any case, I’m looking forward to reading more like this!</p>

			 <p>In <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/techdirt/id940871872?i=1000641079372">this episode of the Techdirt podcast</a> there’s a particularly great metaphor Ravi Iyer uses to describe bad algorithms that reinforce content you don’t want to see more of, and yet draws you in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will eat donuts, and so I kind of “want” donuts, by one definition of “want.” I will eat them if you put them in front of me. But I don’t aspire to eat more donuts. I want to eat healthier food, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When my wife was pregnant a couple years ago, Instagram started serving her more and more posts from people who had traumatic birthing stories, or who had lost babies, either during childbirth or soon after. When something like that comes up, you can’t exactly look away. Especially for her (and for me) being a hardcore empath. I don’t think it’s a bad thing that people post about their real stories, in fact I encourage it. But for Instagram to identify that she was more “engaged” with these posts and then to say “I bet she wants more!” is pretty messed up. It’s a negative spiral that might have driven her to spend more time on the platform (thus increasing her value as a user, from Instagram’s view) but produced a very negative mental impact on her. That’s what people talk about when wanting to get away from the algorithm.</p>

			 <p>This is a non-comprehensive list of some things I want to achieve in the new year. Maybe I’ll set reminders to check in on this as the year goes on.</p>
<h2 id="downsize">Downsize</h2>
<p>I want less stuff. Every time we move there’s a box or two full of random stuff that just sits in another box or drawer until we move again. Not great! But also so tedious to go through! I&rsquo;d love to take a week and just really decide what things I need, and what things are weighing me down. And also figure out eBay.</p>
<h2 id="read-a-book-each-month">Read a book each month</h2>
<p>I read my first full books since high school this year, and I enjoyed it a lot. I always envy readers and bookworms. I have a lot of other media I like that can eat away at my free time (games, shows, films). Zelda especially has just torpedoed my free time. I’ve loved every second of it, but wow is there a lot to do in that game.</p>
<p>Getting off topic. Point is: time short, want read book. I got a couple for Christmas so I&rsquo;ll start there! To make it more of a tangible goal, I&rsquo;ll try to read one book each month. I can already tell you I&rsquo;ll fail but at least it gives me a framework.</p>
<h2 id="brush-up-on-a-language">Brush up on a language</h2>
<p>I took three different languages in school: Spanish in junior high, Latin in high school, and German in college. I’d like to brush up on either <strong>Spanish</strong> or <strong>German</strong> in the new year.</p>
<p><strong>Spanish</strong> is vastly more practical for me because of where I live, and would be used weekly if not daily.</p>
<p><strong>German</strong> is of interest to me because my family is from Switzerland. Ideally I’d love to learn the <strong>Swiss-German</strong> my extended family speaks, but learning resources are scarce. And nearly all of them are fluent in English so it’s not a pressing matter. Just would feel nice to connect more with that family history.</p>
<p>Then there’s an entirely impractical side of me that wants to learn <strong>Japanese</strong>. Japan is the Switzerland of Asia in a lot of ways and visiting this past summer made me want to go back so badly. Probably has the most uphill battle to learn though, so maybe I’ll leave that for another year.</p>
<p>My tentative plan is to put on some videos and such while I do dishes or other chores, when my ears and brain are a captive audience!</p>
<h2 id="establish-a-workout-rhythm">Establish a workout rhythm</h2>
<p>This is such the stereotypical New Year’s resolution, but yeah, I’d like to get fit. Specifically, <em>I want to know what it’s like to feel “in shape”.</em> Especially since becoming a father, there are so many things in my daily life that I think would be so much easier if my muscles were just a bit stronger or my heart and lungs a little more efficient.</p>
<p>How am I going to do this? Not sure yet. There’s a gym club near us that offers childcare so I might try that for a bit. I’ve tried running before and I liked it when I could find the time for it. And Fitness+ gets flack but I’ve done quite a few exercises through it and it’s honestly quite enjoyable.</p>
<p>I’ll end up doing a combo. Or nothing at all. But maybe me saying this into the internet will provide some sense of accountability. Ideally I just want to get into a sustainable rhythm. Doesn&rsquo;t have to be much, just something.</p>
<h2 id="use-public-transit">Use public transit?</h2>
<p>This is a tough one for me. Right now I live in the mountains on a somewhat steep, busy, and narrow road with a lot of blind turns. This makes riding a bike a bit treacherous from my home, especially after dark. When the days start to get longer, I&rsquo;d like to try riding my bike to the bus station and ride the bus to work more often. It tags on quite a bit of extra time in my commute, but I&rsquo;ve just grown to really resent driving recently. Tough in a car-dependent area of a car-dependent nation.</p>
<h2 id="unlock-the-power-of-costco">Unlock the power of Costco</h2>
<p>At the end of this year we went to Costco a few times and I forgot how much is there in terms of building blocks for easy meals. I want to come up with some meal plans using Costco stuff to cut down on grocery costs and also make dinner a bit easier at the end of the day.</p>
<hr>
<p>Well that&rsquo;s about it. I have some other vague goals of journaling or meditating but I can&rsquo;t really put it into words yet.</p>
<p>See you in a few months, wall of text.</p>

			 <p>It would be wrong of me to let a Sufjan release go by without urging people to <a href="https://sufjanstevens.lnk.to/javelin">listen to it</a>. What a perfect way to enter autumn.</p>
<p>This is arguably his most accessible album in a decade, not only musically but lyrically. It’s not at all as pretentious and historical as <em>Illinois</em>, and not quite as depressive as <em>Carrie &amp; Lowell</em> (although, I have to briefly defend that album’s depressiveness by saying that “Fourth of July,” with it’s lovely choral refrain of “we’re all gonna die,” is one of my most listened songs, and pulled me through some very hard times). <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sufjan-stevens-javelin/">Pitchfork</a> put it nicely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the lyrics on <em>Javelin</em> lack the proper-noun touchstones of Stevens’ story-songs, these ones gain authority from an intrinsic sense of self and place. They are approachable like pop songs, but delivered with the same precision as his folk confessionals. They break our hearts from within.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I should also mention <a href="https://sufjan.com/post/730446434104754176/sufjan-stevens-javelin">the dedication to his late partner Evans Richardson</a>. There’s not a lot I can add to this. I can just say I really appreciate Sufjan’s transparency through such a difficult time of life. <em>Javelin</em> makes it clear that it wasn’t always an easy relationship, and he says as much in his post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know relationships can be very difficult sometimes, but it’s always worth it to put in the hard work and care for the ones you love, especially the beautiful ones, who are few and far between. If you happen to find that kind of love, hold it close, hold it tight, savor it, tend to it, and give it everything you’ve got, especially in times of trouble. Be kind, be strong, be patient, be forgiving, be vigorous, be wise, and be yourself. Live every day as if it is your last, with fullness and grace, with reverence and love, with gratitude and joy. This is the day the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>❤️</p>

<p>Earlier this month, I went up the mountain through Boulder Creek to Camp Hammer, a 99 acre parcel of land that is surrounded by Big Basin State Park, the oldest State Park in California. Camp Hammer is full of redwoods, oaks, madrones, newts and squirrels, butterflies and bees. There are hills and gulches, fields and thickets. When the warm sunlight hits the redwood duff that covers its floors, a sweet and dusty smell fills up the space between trees. For 50+ years, Camp Hammer was the home of a joyful retreat every summer, where kids from the surrounding area could step away from the world and seek spiritual rejuvenation. Countless memories and friendships and a whole culture were formed around this place. Its buildings were old, but the woods were older. It was a place where you could drop the personality-masks you had to put on the rest of the year and be your own goofy, vulnerable, true self.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/90877/2023/630fdc1a-69af-4ccd-8469-86ac472a00cf-1-201-a.jpeg" alt="The summer staff of 2018. "></p>
<p>Three years ago, in August of 2020, a freak lightning storm set off the biggest fire in the county&rsquo;s recorded history, burning over 86,000 acres. 99 of which belonged to Camp Hammer. The fire burnt down nearly every structure in the camp. Only one of its nine cabins is still standing today, along with a couple of sheds, a patio with a fire pit, and a stage nestled in a fairy ring of redwoods. Lost was the dining hall (which produced the most legendary cookies), the fellowship hall, five residences, the pool, and a couple of facilities.</p>
<p>I lived and worked in Camp Hammer for three summers and one offseason, and attended every summer since I was old enough to. It holds immense meaning for me. It was my highlight of my year, every year. I became familiar with the shape of its woods, its shortcuts, secret groves where one could seek quiet. I was devastated by the news of its destruction. The whole community was. The sky was red for days. All of Santa Cruz was blanketed with ash.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/90877/2023/img-2131-0001.png" alt="Highway 17 on August 19th, 2020."></p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t visited it since until this month. What I saw and felt was a land that seemed completely re-molded to almost a pre-development state. The curves of the road to Camp become increasingly disorienting as you travel up Big Basin Way . The milestones and guideposts are gone. It&rsquo;s like a motion sickness, or like you&rsquo;ve woken up in an unfamiliar home. Since the fire, massive efforts have been taken to cull the trees that were damaged beyond safety. The shape of the woods itself has changed. The redwoods that lost their limbs but still stand are growing back millions of new branches from their trunk, looking like towering topiaries.</p>
<p>Arriving, we drive past the houses my family and friends had lived, now just subtle clearings in the forest. Pulling down the drive into the camp there&rsquo;s a moment where it feels almost the same. Signs greet you as you travel down the driveway, past the now-drained pond. We pass the community house that I had lived in for a year, now a pile of ground-up foundation. Continuing on, we pass the last cabin standing, and pull in facing the field where the redwood stage is. A fence lines the field, where cabin leaders stood every Sunday to greet their campers. I exit the car and walk onto the field towards the stage. It&rsquo;s exactly how I remember it. The last time I was there was a month before the fires, sitting on this field for a socially-distanced movie night (<em>My Neighbor Totoro</em>)</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/90877/2023/6dd8d8a7-0f73-4f59-b6da-02850c43cb1c-1-102-o.jpeg" alt="The last picture I have at Camp before the fires. "></p>
<p>Then I turn my back on the stage and look up the hill. For a moment my brain fills the gaps. I can see the dining hall and DK Hall, the staff rooms I slept in, and continuing up to the boys' cabins where I spent my every summer since 2007, all the way up, Redwood 1 &amp; 2, Pine, Maple, Oak, and up the grueling final steps to Manzanita.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/90877/2023/fa1dfc41-075c-4a19-bc19-6ead55f7dc08-1-201-a.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>But none of that is there. It&rsquo;s just green. Dense shrubs fill the hill now, covering most of the remaining rubble. It&rsquo;s like I traveled 60 years into the past, or maybe 1000 years into the far future. There is no bell ready to call for dinner. There is no posse setting off to paddle funoes around the pond. There are no campers sitting on Hamburger Hill making lanyards in the shade of the maple tree. Words leave me.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/90877/2023/62be978d-e280-4d81-a46f-e2999b41354e-1-201-a.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>There are places that we hold <em>so</em> dear. These places, like everything in our lives, are <em>so</em> impermanent. Everything is transient. What remains are the memories and images that fill the gaps. When I think about my Oma, I see a woman so strong in her faith and her love for her family, cutting me bite sized pieces of butter and jelly toast, calling me her schunka bolle. She&rsquo;s gone now. But my mind fills the gap she left with those memories, and those memories will stay with me forever and inform the choices I make if I have grandchildren of my own.</p>
<p>The memories that fill the gaps of Camp Hammer are many. The buildings are gone but its woods and its people remain, for a moment. And those memories and people will inform the next chapter of camp, whatever it ends up being.</p>

			 <p>I’m unreasonably excited for <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, so I’ve naturally been talking everyone’s ear off about it, including <a href="https://instagram.com/annakatherine?igshid=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==">Anna</a> (my wife! ❤️). I was talking at her about the series and why it means so much to me and so many others, and the music came up. I played some songs for her and she recognized a lot of them from TikTok and such.</p>
<p>Then I decided to pack my bags and go full nostalgia trip by listening to a bunch of Zelda music on YouTube. It happens.</p>
<p>I ended up going way back to the start. And something really caught my ear about this music from the first Zelda game.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I’ve been listening to the Apple Music Classical series <em><a href="https://classical.music.apple.com/us/album/1675318629">The Story of Classical</a></em>, which I highly recommend. In the episode on the Baroque period, Guy Jones (the host of the series and head of curation for the app) plays back Bach’s <em>Partita No. 2 for D Minor</em>. He calls out Bach’s use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_stop">double and triple stopping</a>, the technique of playing two or more notes at once across multiple strings, and how it implies chords and accompaniment beyond what a solo violin was typically capable of.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The NES was also limited in the sounds it could output. It could play two melody lines at once, with a few different wave types and varying volumes. It could play a bass line at one volume and only in a triangle wave. It had a noise channel that could be used for drums or perhaps some odd melodies. It also had a channel that could play very compressed samples. The video below has a good overview.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can guess where I’m going with this. The original Zelda theme does so much with so little. The high melody sticks to the main notes while the harmony line has a bit more fun with it, echoing and iterating on the theme. The bass keeps everything steady and the drums just tap along. But it <em>implies</em> so much beyond those four channels. You can just <em>feel</em> the whole orchestra playing the theme, starting low and swelling to meet those early high notes. Compare it to the 25th anniversary album that fills in the gaps for the theme:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Excellent as well. But there’s something about the necessary minimalism of the original soundtrack that just hits right. I think something about its implied orchestration ties into that sense of wonder and exploration that has so perfectly been captured in <em>Breath of the Wild</em>. What’s behind that mountain? What’s peeking out from around this hill? Who knows, <strong>there could be a full orchestra around any corner!</strong></p>

			 <p>The rumors of Apple’s AR/VR headset have me thinking about how it might apply to me as a video editor. I’ve long thought that NLEs are somewhat unintuitive systems. Obviously digital video editing can be complex, so it stands to reason that the user interfaces to accomplish it are complex, with a lot of options and control.</p>
<p>But when I think of film editing - meaning physical <em>film</em> editing - it’s somewhat simple at its core. Flatbed editors like the Steenbeck enabled you to get up close and personal with the footage, inspect each frame in its context, then literally cut → trim → paste. This tangibility is somewhat lost in the world of digital video.</p>
<p>I actually think Final Cut Pro X is really close to replicating that tangibility in its UI. Clips aren’t locked to tracks, but instead are anchored by a primary storyline. Dragging a clip into the timeline feels really good. It’s designed with a mouse in mind so it’s really easy to pick up and go. It’s intuitive in the same way cutting footage with scissors and taping them together might feel. It just makes sense.</p>
<p>Another system I&rsquo;ve used recently is <a href="https://scenery.video/">Scenery</a>, currently in beta. It&rsquo;s this unique cross between a traditional NLE - which works in 1.5 dimensions: the timeline axis and track layering - and something like Figma - which works in 2.5 dimensions: x-axis, y-axis, and a simplified z-axis. You can trim clips, freely move them around a board, and conjoin them wherever you want, making the assembly of sequences much more stream-of-consciousness. Then when it&rsquo;s time to get into the weeds a bit more you can pop out these sequences into a more traditional NLE timeline view. This builds on Final Cut&rsquo;s upending of expectations by reintroducing the feeling of strips of film on a table. It&rsquo;s extremely intuitive in that way. It&rsquo;s not a perfect product, but this it does very, very well.</p>
<p>That being said, maybe a mouse isn’t the most intuitive control. I’ve really been enjoying the <a href="https://www.wired.com/review/davinci-resolve-speed-editor/">DaVinci Speed Editor</a> I got a year ago (so much that it&rsquo;s in my profile pic on <a href="https://sfba.social/@davids">Mastodon</a>). The jog wheel is intuitive in the same way the magnetic timeline feels intuitive to me. It just makes sense. A timeline moves in two directions so a single axis controller makes a lot of sense for editing with (although this limitation gets a bit annoying on multi-track timelines, which everything becomes eventually). Pressing the split button and hearing the clunk of the mechanical key feels solid and tangible.</p>
<p>But there’s still a disconnect. Because I’m interacting with something in my physical world and watching a screen update. I think it&rsquo;s the same reason watching magical things happen in a Studio Ghibli film feels more real than a spell cast in a Harry Potter film (or TV show now, apparently 🙄): you, the audience, have already suspended disbelief in engaging with an animated film with animated humans and clearly invented locations. When a character then flies or does something else clearly untrue to reality, there&rsquo;s no leap of faith or broken immersion because the immersion broke when the film started.</p>
<p>While this is unique to narrative mediums, I think something similar happens with regards to user interfaces. It&rsquo;s why people hate video games that halt gameplay and become &ldquo;menu management&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t want to do menu management for my editing system. I just want to put shots together to tell a story. The more you edit, the less you notice the disconnect, but it&rsquo;s still there, especially when projects come to a grinding halt as the program does something you didn&rsquo;t expect or you aren&rsquo;t allowed to do something you thought you could.</p>
<p>This is where something like AR/VR might enter the picture. By leveling the playing field, blurring the lines between our digital interfaces and the physical world or eliminating the lines altogether, I think we&rsquo;re going to see some really novel interfaces appear. Interfaces that might seek to recreate the tangibility of film editing within the realm of digital video editing, or even beyond that, innovating in new directions we might find hard to imagine currently.</p>
<p>That, for me, is a really exciting prospect - to bring physicality into a digital world.</p>

			 <p>Well I’m heading home! Our last two days in Thailand were very low key. Less bussing around and more walking through neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Went back to The Loft Cafe and had an orange iced coffee which was lovely. The shop seems like it’s run by true coffee aficionados. Framed coffee tasting wheels, Thai coffee magazines, a siphon brewer. Even a roaster in the back but I don’t know if they actively roast their beans. I should have grabbed an espresso in retrospect. The coffee scene in Chiang Mai in general has been top notch. Would really love to come back and seek out the best cafés. 😛</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/90877/2023/59de43a80f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Even the coffee shop attached to the hotel, 49 Coffee, was pretty decent. Lovely setting and design at least. I had an espresso this morning that was pretty good, at least on par with most neighborhood shops in the states.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/90877/2023/e20a5c1259.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/90877/2023/c868f1a508.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And two days ago I had an iced latte that took an approach I’d heard of but never tried, at Cup Fine Day: frozen coffee cubes in milk. Scrumptious until you’re left with the cubes. Then it’s a bitter crunch to finish it off.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/90877/2023/9c47e7b653.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/90877/2023/11ce62fe2c.jpg" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/90877/2023/0862a22548.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Suffice to say: good coffee here. Aside from that, great food as well. Had tom kha and phanaeng and both were spicy and scrumptious.</p>

			 <p>One of the more surprising things I&rsquo;ve found on this trip is that my hotel WiFi has symmetrical up/down internet speeds of around 100 mbps. In fact, <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/thailand#market-analysis">according to Speetest.net</a>, Thailand as a country has a median upload speed of 172.95 mbps. There are probably flaws in this dataset, but that&rsquo;s still shocking. The USA <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/global-index/united-states?fixed#market-analysis">in comparison</a> has a measly 22.78 mbps average upload speed.</p>
<p>What this means for me practically is I&rsquo;ve been able to back up my footage every night to multiple cloud services, and it&rsquo;s finished before I go out in the morning. How lovely! 🥰 I can only imagine how wonderful life would be if these kinds of upload speeds were available everywhere in the states. (Insert futuristic society meme.)</p>
<p>Also - realized today I totally should have watched <em>Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives</em> by Apichatpong Weerasethakul, which is a Thai film. I&rsquo;ll watch it on the flight back!</p>
<p>In terms of food (the most important terms), today I ate eggs benedict for breakfast, with an iced coffee and some muesli. In the middle of the day, we went up to the mountains, met some elephants and stopped for khao soi for lunch (delicious!) with an iced latte (yes, I needed it) and mango with sticky rice as a dessert. Later, we walked through the night market on the outside of the old city. We went for Greek food at a place that you <em>had</em> to know was there, otherwise you wouldn&rsquo;t find it. Down this alley and that. I had a falafel &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; (and the falafels were sooo good, not too dry) and a Singha.</p>

			 <p>It’s my first morning in Thailand. Yesterday we got some coffee (I got lychee iced coffee - so good) and for dinner ate crispy pork belly which was transcendent.</p>

<p>On the flight I ended up watching <em>A Brighter Summer Day</em> and <em>Beau travail</em>. Two very different films. Both good. I feel like maybe I wasn’t quite in the right headspace for <em>Beau travail</em> after <em>A Brighter Summer Day</em>, which is so much more rooted in reality.</p>
<p>Last night I offloaded the b-roll and a few interviews I shot and added metadata in Resolve, renaming the clips using Resolve’s smart renaming using the metadata I inputted. Feels good to finally use that organizational method!</p>

			 <p>Over the next six days, I&rsquo;ll be traveling to Chiang Mai, Thailand, to interview some missionaries that the church supports. I thought I&rsquo;d keep a small travel log here for the heck of it. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll keep up with it but at least I&rsquo;ve started.</p>
<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m sitting in the international terminal at SFO waiting to board our flight. We have a 14 hr flight to Taipei and then a 4 hr connecting flight to Chiang Mai, Thailand. I&rsquo;ve downloaded multiple movies that I&rsquo;ve been wanting to watch but haven&rsquo;t because they&rsquo;re either too long to watch after a workday or too heavy. The films I&rsquo;ve downloaded are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Yi Yi</em></li>
<li><em>A Brighter Summer Day</em> (The longest film on the list, clocking in at just under four hours.)</li>
<li><em>A Touch of Zen</em></li>
<li><em>Seven Samurai</em></li>
<li><em>Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy</em></li>
<li><em>Drive My Car</em></li>
<li><em>Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters</em></li>
<li><em>Andrei Rublev</em></li>
<li><em>Stalker</em></li>
<li><em>Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles</em></li>
<li><em>Beau travail</em></li>
<li><em>Cléo from 5 to 7</em> (The shortest film, at an hour and a half.)</li>
<li><em>Metropolis</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see how many of these I&rsquo;ll actually get around to watching. I know I need to sleep but the idea of 14 uninterrupted hours of movie watching time is a delightful prospect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m traveling with some borrowed gear from the church, courtesy of <a href="https://vimeo.com/user10667229">Jamie Rom</a>. I have the Canon R5 shooting in 4K with CLog3 and two lenses: the Canon RF 15-35mm f/2.8 which will be my primary lens, and a 24-105mm for any time I might need a telephoto. The goal is to get tons of b-roll in addition to a solid interview. I&rsquo;m shooting in 4K in the IPB Light codec flavor, mostly so as to optimize card space as I&rsquo;d like to avoid formatting cards while I&rsquo;m on the trip. We&rsquo;ll see how that goes and if I have to pivot midway.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.parks.ca.gov/NewsRelease/1150">The pier at Seacliff is going to be demolished.</a> I know a lot of people grew to dislike the pier. I get it. It’s old. It’s decrepit (esp. post-being-cloven-in-twain earlier this year). It literally stinks up the neighborhoods around it. The SS Palo Alto, a cement ship, intentionally grounded and taking on water since 1929, apparently was once a swanky place to eat. But no one really remembers that anymore. It’s just another disappointment of The Ugliest Pier.</p>
<p>But despite its shortcomings, I’m going to miss the pier. Years of beach days with the church, weaving in and out of its wooden legs. Walking barefoot on its planks and feeling each splinter tug at my skin, like a friendly pinch. Chatting with its pigeons and seagulls, and eyeing the water for a glimpse of a shark in the shallows.</p>
<p>At the end of the pier it felt like you could see the whole bay extend beyond you over the waters. You could hear the sounds of birthday party barbecues, and, cutting past the noise of the breaking waves, the soft sound of that one guy who plays the trumpet at Rio Del Mar.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful, messed up wreck. Maybe that’s why I liked it so much.</p>
<p><em>Attached are some snaps I took of the pier last year with my Canonet.</em></p>

			 <p><a href="https://juliapott.substack.com/p/2b-or-not-2b">Great writing by Julia Pott on the nature of pencils</a>. I appreciate the way her newsletters deeply examine the ordinary. Especially love this quote of a quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One would imagine that in the era of computers, the pencil and notepad would have gone obsolete, but quite the opposite. If you walk down a High street, more often than not you’ll encounter a stationary shop, and if you wander inside, as I always do, you’ll find yourself getting lost in all the different writing implements and papers and potentials in front of you. Writer and technologist Kevin Kelly once claimed that “species of technology” are immortal, even if they no longer have an obvious use:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With very few exceptions, technologies don’t die. In this way, they differ from biological species, which in the long-term inevitably do go extinct. The invention of the lightbulb meant that people stopped using candles to light their homes, but the candle didn’t die - its purpose simply changed. It moved from technology to art, and we see it now as romantic rather than a gloomy fire hazard. The crackly imperfection of vinyl became the warmth and charm of the object when compared to the CD or MP3. The limitations of stationary - the fact that ink can smudge or that a page from the notebook can tear - are also part of its appeal.</p>

			 <p>Quite fun. Story’s alright but mostly sits backseat to the gameplay. I grew up on the Jedi Knight games so it felt really good to get back to that type of Star Wars game. Nothing is quite as satisfying as force pushing a bunch of Storm Troopers off a ledge. 😌</p>
<p>I do think some of the criticism around level design makes sense. I thought it was mostly really great but there were a few repetitive moments in backtracking and such. I know they wanted it to feel like a cross between Dark Souls and Metroid, but I don’t know that the Metroidvania type level design lends itself as well to this kind of blockbuster storytelling. I’d rather they took an Uncharted 4 approach but 🤷‍♂️ we’ll see where the next one goes!</p>

			 <p>The best writing of any game I’ve played, hands down. The world is so fascinating and original, textured and many-faceted. It takes a long time to get through (esp. with the voice acting - I can’t allow myself to cut people off) but I actually enjoyed taking it slow. Taking the scenic route, poking around in unlikely places for more information. There are a lot of subtle twists that happen through this - moments where my eyes were wide, waiting for the next turn in a tense conversation. Small, seemingly insignificant pieces of information can cause a ripple effect to dramatically shift the way you once perceived the story thus far, your character, and even the world you inhabit.</p>

			 <blockquote>
<p>At this point, the obsession over IP’s has been digging so deep that studios are pulling obscure IP’s out from decades ago that no one has ever heard of, which completely negates the original point of doing reboots and remakes of old IP’s in the first place. It’s just cringey and desperate feeling and I’m embarrassed on their behalf when I see it.</p>
<p>What’s even crazier is the amount of execs I’ve met that don’t want to do this (all of them). I’m constantly told by execs that lament about how they wish they could make original stuff and not IP’s, but that their hands are tied. None of us got into this business so that we could remake old stuff. We didn’t watch some movie as an 8-year-old and say “When I grow up, I want to make this same exact movie but for a modern, four-quadrant audience, and as the jumping off point for an extended universe of films.” No one wants to do this, but for some reason, everyone in charge feels forced to.</p>
<p>I mean aren’t we all starting to laugh at and get bored by “universes”? It’s alienating at this point, and a turn off, when you know that a movie or show you’re watching is just there to set up some other movie or season you’re supposed to watch later. You can really feel it in what you’re watching and it just feels gross. Let’s just make things we wanna watch now with an actual ending, then we won’t feel gross when we watch stuff and can just sit and enjoy it!</p>
<p>I think it’s a huge, joyless loss that an entire generation of artists are having their original, unique, and timely voices shifted almost entirely into the IP mines. A loss that I feel won’t be seen or understood fully for at least a decade, but when it happens, will feel like we’re missing an entire part of our collective souls.</p>

			 <p>In my video editing work, sometimes I need to make sure two videos match up perfectly, frame to frame. This could be for a variety of reasons, but today it was because I was conforming an edit that was done in Premiere Pro, to finish it with color and audio in DaVinci Resolve. “<a href="https://blog.frame.io/2019/03/29/conforming-with-resolve/">Conforming</a>” encompasses a lot of things, but for my purposes it basically means, “Did this timeline make it ok from one program to the other? Did anything break? Are all the shots lining up?</p>
<p>I usually start by firing off an export from the original app as a reference video, and lay that reference video on top of my imported timeline in Resolve. Then, I change its blend mode to “Difference.” That does exactly what you’d think – it highlights the differences between the top and bottom clips in the timeline. So when I watch back the program, I should hope to see nothing but blackness, because everything matched up perfectly, right? …right?</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/90877/2022/f9521a25ab.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Shoot. Here I had a clip that used <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/organizing-assets-project-panel.html#change_the_frame_rate_of_a_clip">Premiere’s “Modify → Interpret Footage” workflow</a> for slow motion, something that doesn’t carry over via XML to Resolve<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. So I slowed my 30 FPS clip down to 80% and started slipping it left and right, frame by frame, until the most satisfying moment:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/90877/2022/3f48ad4525.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Ahhhh.</p>
<p>Conforming can be an annoying, frustrating experience at times, so I think it’s important to take a bit of joy in moments like these. Plus, sometimes clips with Difference blending that are slightly off sync can yield some cool results when in motion:</p>

<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>If you’re still using this workflow, I highly recommend just learning to slow things down in the timeline by percentages. ☺️ There’s a whole bunch of issues in Premiere related to using Modify → Interpret Footage for slow mo. If you edit in Final Cut you’re lucky because there’s a command for automating that! Search for “Automatic Speed” in the keyboard shortcut customization window and bask in Apple’s occasional rightdoing with FCPX.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/30-years-of-art-house-hits-a-tribute-to-sony-pictures-classics">Criterion added a slew of films to its streaming site for Sony Pictures Classics’ 30th anniversary</a>. There are a few in here I’ve seen but a lot more I’ve been waiting to see. On my watchlist:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Persepolis</em></li>
<li><em>Run Lola Run</em></li>
<li><em>Orlando</em></li>
<li><em>Paprika</em></li>
<li><em>Volver</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If I get around to watching them (which is tough as a new parent working full-time and going into the holidays), I’ll be logging them <a href="https://letterboxd.com/theschlaepfer/">on my Letterboxd account</a>. (I wonder if there’s a Letterboxd → Micro.blog crossposting tool?)</p>

			 <p>If you aren’t yet acquainted with <a href="https://bigthief.net">Big Thief</a> and by extension <a href="https://www.adriannelenker.com/">Adrianne Lenker</a>, I suggest you have some acquaintin’ to do. They make delightful music that walks the line between folk &amp; rock &amp; electronic &amp; country &amp; most of the subgenres within. Their <a href="https://bigthief.ffm.to/dnwmibiy.owe">latest album</a> has been on my rotation all year. Plus it has the dorkiest cover.</p>
<p>When I first heard them I was like <a href="https://youtu.be/UkiI2vM2lfA?t=134">“Yeah whatever, you’re sort of pitchy.”</a> But now they’re one of the few bands I call myself a fan of.</p>
<p>A few of my favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5OV1JPqlNQ">Mary</a>. A quiet storybook hymn. Best enjoyed with headphones in a dark room.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1QlOfYxykI">Shark Smile</a>. Contains the most wonderful “woo!”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MumyOxKPrTE">No Reason</a>. Listen for the sing-along chorus. Stick around for the sick flute solo.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eElc7PX63xQ">Two Hands</a>. Clappity clap clap. Great percussion.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkIvGej2WyI">Time Escaping</a>. Bonkers track.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B77YDZwMV4">Terminal Paradise</a>. Really great build.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMD2OGlgAEg">Red Moon</a>. Leans hard into hoedown mode. That link is a video of them recording it live.</li>
</ul>
<p>And a handful from Adrianne:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjB3Qwjcimw">from</a>. Just haunting. Get’s the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DM74fc2Umo0">full band</a> treatment also.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsl9IZxxY0I">not a lot, just forever</a>. Really sweet love song. Makes me swoon.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cYWc_wzuiU">forwards beckon rebound</a>. Showcases Adrianne’s rhythmic fingerpicking.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>I was born too late to know the height of blogs in the mid-00s. However I <strong>have</strong> seen <em>Julie &amp; Julia</em> and I <strong>do</strong> have delusions of grandeur. So here I am. Where once I simply tweeted my thoughts into the abyss, I shall now blog them furiously into an even abyssier abyss. I’ll probably regret it 👍</p>
<p>Hoping to blog about all sorts of things. Whatever’s interesting to me, I guess. I imagine it’ll mostly revolve around video editing, <a href="www.dcscreative.com">which I do for a living</a>. I also <a href="www.instagram.com/theschlaepfer">enjoy</a> taking <a href="pixelfed.social/@theschlaepfer">photos</a> for <a href="https://vs.co/f05t2k7m">fun</a>, but I wouldn’t say I’m a photographer. Similarly, I’ve recently been making a simple app for the <a href="https://play.date">Playdate</a> called <a href="https://theschlaepfer.itch.io/the-drawing-board">The Drawing Board</a>, but I’m <strong>definitely</strong> not a developer. I love hearing developers talk tho, and love using beautiful apps. Currently, I’m typing this in Ulysses, which I haven’t cracked open since college. It’s refreshing. :)</p>
<p>See ya ✌️</p>

			 <p>ok, soap box time.</p>
<p>my wife (!) opened her gallery show this week to cap off her bachelor&rsquo;s of fine arts program. anna poured so much effort into this show, pretty much just hitting the ground running right after our honeymoon. through so much difficulty (getting dropped from all her classes, an earlier show date than expected, advisors not showing up for meetings, artwork falling off the walls, and much much more), she has stayed so strong and determined to finish this semester well. i&rsquo;m so so proud of her, and this show is a triumph and testament to her hard work throughout her school career.</p>
<p>i love you @annakatherine. i can&rsquo;t wait to see where your art takes you (and us!)</p>

			 <p>Two years ago, you were going to go to Biola, I couldn&rsquo;t drive, and neither of us had ever had a job.

Since then, you&rsquo;ve moved to another city, I began college, and we worked at a summer camp together. We&rsquo;ve grown so much over what simultaneously feels like a day and a lifetime.
.
Two years ago, we held hands for the first time, and my world changed.</p>

When you&rsquo;re upset or stressed out or anxious she sees that and she understands you deeply. This joy she brings through this gift can turn any bad day into a good one, and any good day into a great one.
.
She is perhaps my favorite person in the world, and I am so thankful that she&rsquo;s a part of my life.

Here&rsquo;s to one trip around the sun, and to the many more yet to come.

			 <p>Worship music bugs me. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just too happy. Or too fake-happy, or something. I wish more faith-based bands wrote songs like the Psalms. Where sometimes David really does sing the praises of God, and really is genuinely happy. But other times his songs are filled with doubt and uncertainty and crying out for help. I understand singing worship songs in church, kind of as a pick-me-up, but listening to them at home feels so inauthentic sometimes, because sometimes I don&rsquo;t feel the happiness or the belief that the songs sing. The song &ldquo;Casimir Pulaski Day&rdquo; by Sufjan Stevens is by no means a worship song, but in some ways I feel like it sounds more like a Psalm than anything worship artists are putting out. It ends with &ldquo;He takes and He takes and He takes&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s important to know that other believers are feeling doubt and anger too. Because we all feel it, and denying that is lying to the entire Church.
Anyways, that rant was probably way too long, but it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s been on my mind.</p>

			 <p>More film. HEY YO you people who still shoot 35mm, how do you convert it to digital? What&rsquo;s your workflow? Because right now what I&rsquo;m doing works, but kinda saps the image of juicy color and makes the shadows look a little weird. Your input is appreciated.</p>

			 <p>35mm from Yosemite. // In terms of efficiency and not-pain-in-the-butt-ness, digital photos are so much better, but there&rsquo;s definitely a certain magic about taking photos on film. The photos feel like your own, y&rsquo;know? They feel like they were produced out of your own blood, sweat and tears. That&rsquo;s kind of gross. Never mind. You get the idea.</p>

			 <p>My dear Oma gently passed away early this morning. When I heard the news, I was honestly filled with joy. Where she is now is so much better than anything she could have experienced here. She lived a very full life, and now she&rsquo;s living an even fuller eternity.</p>
<p>She kept a journal for a while and in one of the entries she wrote, &ldquo;It makes such a difference when one believes that we live only a short time on this earth, but an eternity in heaven. And the comfort we have that one day we will see our loved ones again. I wonder if they are helping to prepare a place for us.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Remember the days when I regularly posted photos and didn&rsquo;t wait several weeks between posts? I&rsquo;ve just been so preoccupied with school and music and movie-making and tests and animations and existential crises and a whole slew of fun and not-fun life-stuff. Beginning to focus on actually living my life, and part of me is afraid of that, y&rsquo;know? Life&rsquo;s intimidating, so I feel like I tend to use Instagram or Facebook to escape my life, when it&rsquo;s really best to face it head on. That&rsquo;s how we grow. Okay, so yeah: picture of candles = existential caption. Sorry bout that.</p>

<p>Oma has Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, and it&rsquo;s been heartbreaking to see her decline. My dad said last night that we&rsquo;ve essentially been watching her die a little every day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we had a little family get-together to eat delicious food and say goodbye to Oma. She was so tired. Eventually she started heading to bed, and right before she settled in for the night, we prayed over her and hugged her. She was practically falling over, she was so tired, but if there&rsquo;s one thing that would keep Oma awake, it&rsquo;s hugs. She could hug forever and ever and never get tired of it. Right after I hugged her and kissed her goodnight, she stuttered something like &ldquo;I- I&hellip; la&hellip; lof.&rdquo; We were upstairs laughing and crying and reminiscing and such when Oma woke up and meandered upstairs. When she saw us all she quickly realized it wasn&rsquo;t morning and that she&rsquo;d only been asleep about an hour. She laughed a little at that, and said things like &ldquo;oh&rdquo; and &ldquo;psh&rdquo;, and would point at us all and smile.</p>
<p>We all told her that it was okay and she ended up hugging a few of us again. Then, mid-hug, she pointed at her head and said, with quite a bit of strength, &ldquo;is- is s-stupa!&rdquo; We all of course comforted her and told her she wasn&rsquo;t stupid, and she&rsquo;d say &ldquo;yes, yes&rdquo; and we&rsquo;d say &ldquo;no, no&rdquo; and such. After a few tears and hugs, my mom led us all in a chorus of &ldquo;When We All Get To Heaven&rdquo; and Oma joined in and danced a little. Then we sent her to bed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many more days I&rsquo;ll be able to see my Oma here on Earth. But I&rsquo;m immeasurably excited to spend eternity with her. I want to listen to all her stories, I want to hear her funny Swiss accent, I want to see her as a beautiful young woman again. &ldquo;When we all get to Heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be.
When we all see Jesus,
We&rsquo;ll sing and shout the victory!&rdquo;</p>

Milton lies out on the bike path I use to get home every now and then, and each time has rubbed against my leg when I stop, and let&rsquo;s me scratch his head. He also runs after me when I leave, which makes it oh so hard to go. Thank you, Milton, for making my trip back home so much cooler. #storyportrait</p>
